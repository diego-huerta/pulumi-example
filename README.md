# Pulumi test issue example
This is a pulumi project made to demonstrate
some issues that happen when you try to test the resources

## Instructions
Run 'yarn run test' or 'npm run test'

## Details
When you try to create a resource that is a
property of an object the execution ends
(you can see this behavior if you use a debugger)
This project is an example project because I cannot
disclose the real code that actually throws the same error
for company policies. Have in mind that this is
a very simplified version.
